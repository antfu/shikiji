# Introduction

<span text-xl text-green>
<b><span text-brand-yellow>Shiki</span><span text-brand-red>ji</span></b> <ruby text-brand-yellow>式<rt>shiki</rt></ruby><ruby text-brand-red>辞<rt>ji</rt></ruby>
</span> is a beautiful and powerful syntax highlighter based on TextMate grammar and themes, the same engine as VS Code's syntax highlighting. Provides very accurate and fast syntax highlighting for almost any mainstream programming language.

No custom RegExp to maintain, no custom CSS to maintain, no custom HTML to maintain. And as your favorite languages and themes in VS Code evolve - your syntax highlighting will evolve too.

Shikiji is a ESM-rewrite of [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) with quite a few improvements. We aim to [merge this project back to Shiki as a milestone update](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/510). Check the [breaking changes from Shiki and our compatibility build](/guide/compat) if you are migrating.

About the name, <ruby text-lg text-brand-yellow>式<rt>shiki</rt></ruby><ruby text-lg text-brand-red>辞<rt>ji</rt></ruby> is a Japanese word meaning ["Ceremonial Speech"](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%BC%8F%E8%BE%9E). <ruby text-brand-yellow text-lg>式<rt>shiki</rt></ruby> is inherited from [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) means ["Style"](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%BC%8F) and <ruby text-brand-red text-lg>辞<rt>ji</rt></ruby> means ["Word"](https://jisho.org/word/%E8%BE%9E).

Oh btw, the code blocks in this document are highlighted by Shikiji, as you'd expect \:)

## Features

- All grammars/themes/wasm served as pure-ESM, no more [CDN](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki#specify-a-custom-root-directory), no more [assets](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki#specify-how-to-load-webassembly).
- Portable. Does not rely on Node.js APIs or the filesystem, works in any modern JavaScript runtime.
- ESM-only ([CDN Usage](/guide/install#cdn-usage), [CJS Usage](/guide/install#cjs-usage)).
- [Bundles languages/themes composedly](/guide/install#fine-grained-bundle).
- [Light/Dark themes support](/guide/dual-themes).

- [TypeScript Twoslash](/packages/twoslash).
- [Shiki-compatible build](/guide/compat).

## Playground

Here is a little playground for you to try out how Shikiji highlights your code. Unlike other code blocks that ran on the build time, this playground is rendered on the client side in the browser. Themes and languages are loaded on demand.
